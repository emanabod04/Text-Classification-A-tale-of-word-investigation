Natural language processing tries to make computers understand human language. This might be very abstract, but in practice, this what it’s all about. One of the most interesting challenges in natural language processing is text classification. Text classification’s purpose is to categorize text into one or more categories automatically.
# Conclusion
We trained different combinations of transformations and algorithms. The model with
the highest accuracy is SVM+TF-IDF which yields around 98% accuracy. It’s often
the case that we want to remove every unnecessary word so that we will make sure
they are not affecting what is the model learning.
LDA is also a potential technique that could explain what words associate with
which user. It could also be used for training other models, which should yield more
accurate results than traditional transfromation methods.
